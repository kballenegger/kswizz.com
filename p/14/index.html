                                <h1 class="title">The Power of the Cloud</h1>
                        

                        <p>a.k.a. What It Feels Like Having Two Months Of Your Digital Life Wiped, And Then Subsequently Restored Thanks To Cloud Computing</p>

<p>I’m usually pretty diligent about backing up regularly. I’ve even got a terabyte drive and a Time Capsule both setup to backup automatically. But these last few months have been quite eventful. I’ve finished up my first year of college at the California College of the Arts, moved into a new apartment, and took up a job at <a href="http://tapulous.com/" target="_blank">Tapulous</a>. With all this commotion, I never managed to take the time to setup my Time Capsule.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, my hard drive dies on me last Friday, literally the same day I get the Time Capsule out of its box and end up putting off setting it up to the weekend. At the moment, I paniced a little, thinking of how catastrophic a two-month data loss would be. All my photos, my music, my work, my whole digital life… gone!</p>

<p>So, though a little depressed, I decided to take the opportunity to perform a much-needed clean install. As I was setting up my most frequently used software, and putting back in all my accounts, I realized that I had not lost as much as I feared. The first sign was in re-installing 1Password, the app which contained all my password and important banking credentials. Luckily, I had set its database to be stored in my free <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTI1NTQwMDI5" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>* folder, which syncs automatically to the cloud. Getting that restored was as easy as typing my Dropbox credentials in.</p>

<p>Through MobileMe, all my emails, calendars, address book, keychain and settings were preserved. I managed to recover my lost photos and music from my iPhone using Ecamm’s great <a href="http://www.ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/" target="_blank">PhoneView</a> app. My work was under source control, and was regularly pushed back onto my servers (git is amazing, really!). My Things library synced back from my iPhone onto my Mac. Various other services (including Google’s) kept track of other aspects of my digital life. It’s amazing how much data was able to survive this otherwise catastrophic crash. What couldn’t be recovered was restored to its month-ago state. This include most of my schoolwork, and business data. Thankfully, I hand’t done any schoolwork in the last month, and the data loss on that front was pretty minor overall.</p>

<p>In order to make sure this never happens again, though, I have committed to keeping all of my data in the cloud. I signed up for a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTI1NTQwMDI5" target="_blank">Dropbox Pro</a> account, to which I moved my iPhoto Library, Things Library and any folder where I store documents. As a bonus, I get all that data now synced up between any Mac I own, and my iPhone and iPad.</p>

<p>I am now fully convinced that Cloud Computing is the biggest step technology has taken since the invention of the computer.</p>

<p>* Full Disclosure: referral link, gets me an extra 500MB of storage, and gives you an extra 250MB if you sign up using that link.</p>

                        <p>Adam Lisagor on the iPad taking the TV’s role in our lives:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has done a tremendous amount of work putting [the iPad] in our hands (and on our knees, chests and laps), and showing us how it fits in our lives, in all the right places. As I said before, all the right places, all those places between on-the-go and at-your-desk, they turn out to be a lot of places. We spend a great deal of time in places other than our offices and in transit. So I think of all those places Apple has, with its advertising, shown us comfortably using the iPad, and I can’t help but note that they’re pretty consistently places where I’d want to mellow out and turn on some TV.</p>

                            The first type is exactly what you’d expect: they’re the technologists, the guys who would invent computers if they didn’t already exist. On their nth beer they can discuss the fine points of objc_msgSend_stret().<br>
While they’re talking to you they’re also, in their heads, optimizing the queueing algorithm at the bar, writing their first quantum computing application, and stepping through the code they wrote just an hour ago.<br>
The second type is tech-inflected liberal arts types. Journalists and bloggers are often of this type — but a perhaps-surprising number of developers are too. They’d rather discuss Gogol and Gaga, Kafka and Kubrick, Borges and Black Eyed Peas.

                            <p>Marco Arment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s easy to glorify Verizon as an iPhone owner, because AT&amp;T is so awful. But Verizon sucks, too — just in different ways, for the most part.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve been saying all along that as much as AT&amp;T’s coverage sucks, I’ve generally been happy with their service. The lack of tethering sucks, but I <a href="http://kswizz.com/2010-04-03/tether-ipad-iphone" target="_blank">get around it</a>. Customer representatives I’ve encountered are usually helpful and pleasant to converse with while things get taken care of. They acknowledge jailbreakers with amusement and complicity. Things take forever to get fixed, but the same can be said of any other large company. Even Apple, in my experience, does a much poorer job of helping me out beyond the very basic stuff they’re trained to deal with every day.</p>

<p>This isn’t meant to be a glowing review of AT&amp;T. There are still plenty of major problems, not least of which is the ridiculously poor coverage. I get dropped calls <em>all the time</em>. The network’s inability to deal with density makes it impossible to use my phone at any crowded event. (Attending a conference, concert, festival, expo? Forget about using your iPhone.) But I don’t expect any of that to change should I switch to Verizon. In fact, I expect the few improvements in coverage to be offset by major worsening of the situation in other areas. Ethics, customer relations, and technological innovations are all areas in which AT&amp;T has the upper hand.</p>

                            <p>Astute observation by Marco Arment. So much for the benefits of a closed App Store. It’s a known fact that the vast majority of the App Store’s 200,000 apps are junk. I just wish Apple would make up its mind and either curate the App Store to make it a premium quality store, or make it completely open and let the consumers vote with their credit card.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first two pages of search results for “angry birds”: The first two are real. Rocket Bird 3D and MY BEST FRIEND are other things (although probably keyword spammers). The other <em>six</em> of the top ten results for this game’s name are pure spam. Judging from the number of customer ratings, a lot of people are downloading them — and, reading the reviews, it looks like they’re mostly scams and ripoffs </p>
