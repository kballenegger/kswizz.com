                                    <h1 class="title">How to fix the US economy in a week*</h1>
                        

                        <p>* if the president had dictator-like powers and could bypass congress.</p>

<p><strong>Monday:</strong> Morning coffee. Get ready for a crazy week. Declare economic state of emergency, or whatever other excuse will let a president do whatever he deems necessary for a week.</p>

<p>Start with taxes. Abolish progressive taxes. Set fixed-rate income tax at 35% on any income above $30,000. (10% goes to states.)</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Declare immediate retreat from all wars and “police actions” in the Middle East. Cut defense spending by 80%.</p>

<p>Reinstate NASA space program, and reallocate ample funding. Pledge $500B to the construction of a high-speed rail network to cover the entire continental US. Work to be completed over 5 years by the private sector, with no union labor.</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Abolish Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid—to be phased out by the end of the year. Announce new legislation to 1) force private insurers to offer a basic health plan with minimum benefits at a fixed rate, and 2) make health insurance mandatory.</p>

<p>Announce immigration reform. Lower requirements and processing times of work visas, and instate new entrepreneurship visa program. Announce a one-time amnesty on illegal immigration, and announce legislation with severe consequences for future infractions.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday:</strong> Abolish oil subsidies, let oil spike to $8/gallon. Order cities over 100,000 inhabitants to develop high-quality public transportation networks. Slash all street parking, and impose a parking tax to discourage car commute.</p>

<p>Pledge $500B in state-owned nuclear and alternative energy developments.</p>

<p><strong>Friday:</strong> Announce plan to subsidize employment in creative industries. Subsidize people working as artisans, journalists, artists in order to put to good use people who have been rendered obsolete by advances in technology.</p>

<p>Drastically cut corporate income tax to 13%, in order incentivize corporations to remain headquartered in the US and keep employing US citizens.</p>

<p>Sigh. Enjoy the cool breeze on the White House balcony, sip on a glass of single malt scotch, and get ready to take a much-deserved weekend rest.</p>
