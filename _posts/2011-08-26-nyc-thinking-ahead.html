                            <p>One of the really amazing things about New York City is the extent to which the city anticipated its own growth. It built elevated rail systems to neighborhoods that didn’t exist. A grid that went into the Bronx when the city barely made it to 14th St. A huge city park in the middle of nowhere. Tech guys have to think like that. So few do. Seriously.</p>

<p>People who do this think this way should win awards. It goes beyond design. It isn’t a matter of how rich you are. It’s how boldly you think, and then execute to that vision. And also how flexible you are, when you learn things about your framework that you didn’t envision (so it goes beyond vision as well). And you not only let other people play, but build that in from the start.</p>
