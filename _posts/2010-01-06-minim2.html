  <p>Minim 1.0 was released over 3 years ago in November 2006. Since then it received just 2 updates, version 1.1 and 1.2. It suffered right from the start from my inexperience, not only at coding, but at creating a product that can sell. Since then I’ve released 2 successful products and become a much better developer.</p>
  
  <p>So when it came to working on Minim 2.0, it made sense to treat it as an entirely new product. I used the experienced I’d gained over the past 3 years and re-designed and re-coded it from the ground up. I added some new features that weren’t in 1.x and took several features out that weren’t particularly useful. I made sure to justify everything that went into the app, rather than just saying “Well that would be cool” as I did with 1.x.</p>

<p>When it’ll ship, I could say pretty much the exact same thing about Exces 2.0.</p>

<p>Martin, congratulations on shipping! Minim 2.0 looks neat.</p>
