                            <p>Kyle Meyer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’re riding a high, you just put together a design that you couldn’t be more proud of. […] You’re on top of the world and no one can stop you. At least in your head—and that’s all that matters.</p>
  
  <p>Flash forward a month later. You’re struggling to come up with new ideas, fresh thinking, sound logic. […] You wonder if it is all pointless. Your parents wanted you to be an engineer and you let them down for that fancy-pants art school. You envy the mundane: the mindlessness of it all. Screw it—you’ll be happier flipping burgers. Maybe you’ll come up with a fancy way to swirl the ketchup and mustard into the restaurant’s logo.</p>
  
  <p>Repeat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brilliant. Also, very true. I’ve only pasted snippets. Read the whole thing.</p>
