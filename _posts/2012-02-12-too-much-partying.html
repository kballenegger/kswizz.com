<p>This semester at CCA, I’m taking an Advanced Motion Graphics class. This is my first project: a short video which visually illustrates the feeling one gets when going clubbing and drinking, and the night gets crazier and crazier, until it morphs into something that isn’t so fun anymore.</p>

<p>Partying is fun, but it’s important to know one’s limits. I’ve made that mistake many times, and have had many a regretful mornings.</p>
