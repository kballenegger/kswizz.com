<blockquote>
  <p>We’re a small team of Tapulous alumni who banded together to package up everything we learnt about marketing iPhone apps and turn it into an awesome product. We’ve worked on building, running and marketing hit apps and, through trial and error, figured out what worked and what didn’t. Now, we’re building a service that brings together the best cross-promotion and marketing techniques.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven’t had a chance to mention this yet, but I’ve left Tapulous to join two good friends of mine, Sean and Maria, at an exciting new startup in San Francisco city. I’m very excited to see what we can build here, and look forward to sharing some of what I learn on this blog in the future.</p>
