  <p>Imagine my delight so many months ago at seeing the trailers and posters for this, your much anticipated return to science fiction movie making. To see the title AVATAR (all caps!) typeset in yours truly. Well, I practically wept. And to be rendered in such an artificial luminescent wayâ€¦ finally, in the hands of a true visionary such as yourself, my potential to look totally badass had been realized.</p>

<p>I almost puked when I saw yellow Papyrus being used for the subtitles in Avatar.</p>
