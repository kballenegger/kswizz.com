                            I’m sure you’ve heard Benjamin Franklin’s quote a million times: “They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.” But have you ever really listened to it? Because it seems almost unthinkably arrogant for you to tell us that after 200 years of living under the American constitution Ben helped write, you have a better way, which is to make us “safe” with fear and personal invasion. It seems like you are pissing on the graves of the millions of Americans who died defending our constitution in world wars and other struggles, who were willing to trade their lives for not their liberty but ours, for you to tell us that now we must give up our constitutional protections in order to be safe in our lives.
