                            <blockquote>
  <p>An iPad app called Web Albums HD has reportedly been rejected from the App Store for including a pinch-to-expand feature in its Picasa albums viewing functionality. The developers allegedly hand-coded a pinch-to-expand feature for their galleries to match Apple’s official photo app, but were told by App Store editors that the feature was “associated solely with Apple applications.”</p>

<p>This is what scares me about developing for Apple’s closed App Store. I’ve experienced some <a href="http://www.seoxys.com/apples-increasingly-ridiculous-rejections/" target="_blank">nasty rejections</a>, and there’s definitely no worse feeling than having to throw away your hard work because of Apple’s whim.</p>
