                        <p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/30/humbug/" target="_blank">Paul Carr</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To make money — real money — at this game you have to attract millions, or tens of millions, of users. And when you’re dealing with those kinds of numbers, it’s literally impossible not to treat your users as pieces of data. It’s ironic, but depressingly unsurprising, that web 2.0 is using faux socialization and democratization to create a world where everyone is reduced to a number on a spreadsheet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m having a hard time keeping the quoting-paul-carr to actual content ratio reasonable, but as with so much of his writing, this is spot on.</p>
