                        <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/opinion/sunday/what-happened-to-obamas-passion.html?_r=3&amp;ref=opinion&amp;pagewanted=all" target="_blank">Drew Westen for the New York Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those were the shoes — that was the historic role — that Americans elected Barack Obama to fill. The president is fond of referring to “the arc of history,” paraphrasing the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous statement that “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” But with his deep-seated aversion to conflict and his profound failure to understand bully dynamics — in which conciliation is always the wrong course of action, because bullies perceive it as weakness and just punch harder the next time — he has broken that arc and has likely bent it backward for at least a generation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Drew’s opinion piece is fantastic, and does a perfect job at describing my feeling about Obama’s presidency—only much more eloquently.</p>
