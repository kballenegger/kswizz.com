<blockquote>
  <p>I like to order Martinis. Sometimes I stick with whiskey on ice. My friend likes white wine.</p>
  
  <p>Apparently these drinks say things about us. They say more than “he likes gin.” They’re easy targets. “That’s an alcoholic’s drink,” I’ve heard. “That’s a girl drink.”</p>
  
  <p>I reject that.</p>

  <p>A drink isn’t a girl drink or a tough guy drink. It’s your drink. There’s no point in consuming some shitty-tasting rotgut because you want to keep up appearances. Drink what you want.</p>

<p>I wholeheartedly agree. You have no idea how much shit I get for occasionally liking and drinking Apple Martinis.</p>
