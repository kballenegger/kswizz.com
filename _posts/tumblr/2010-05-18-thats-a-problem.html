                            <p>Astute observation by Marco Arment. So much for the benefits of a closed App Store. It’s a known fact that the vast majority of the App Store’s 200,000 apps are junk. I just wish Apple would make up its mind and either curate the App Store to make it a premium quality store, or make it completely open and let the consumers vote with their credit card.</p>

<p>The first two pages of search results for “angry birds”: The first two are real. Rocket Bird 3D and MY BEST FRIEND are other things (although probably keyword spammers). The other <em>six</em> of the top ten results for this game’s name are pure spam. Judging from the number of customer ratings, a lot of people are downloading them — and, reading the reviews, it looks like they’re mostly scams and ripoffs </p>
