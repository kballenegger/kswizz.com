                        <p>So you bought a WiFi iPad, and you already have an iPhone. You don’t want to pay extra for yet another monthly 3G subscription, and/or you don’t want to wait for the 3G iPad to come out later this month. Thankfully, you can use your iPhone’s 3G connection on your iPad using the following magic recipe.</p>

<p>You will need:<br>
- A jailbroken iPhone. (Google for “blackra1n” if you need help with this)<br>
- $9.99<br>
- Optional ingredient: an extra battery pack for your iPhone, because this is pretty draining on the iPhone.<br>
- A pinch of fairy dust to make things go extra smooth. (Just kidding about that one)</p>

<p>Search for the app MyWi on Cydia and install it. That’ll also install another package manager called Rock. You will have to create a Rock ID. This will allow you to have a free 10-day trial of MyWi, and then to purchase it using your credit card or PayPal account.</p>

<p>Using MyWi, create a WiFi network from your iPhone. You may want to give it a password, to prevent strangers from leeching off your connection. Connect from your iPad, and watch the magic happen. Don’t forget to turn MyWi off on your phone when you aren’t using it, or it’ll drain your its battery dry in no time.</p>
