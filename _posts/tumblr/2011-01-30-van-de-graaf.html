                            <p>If you’re a graphic designer, you’re probably familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canons_of_page_construction" target="_blank">canons of page construction</a>. In book design, canons of page construction help you use aesthetically pleasing and balanced text block and margins. It has been used by many typographers throughout the ages, starting with the Gutenberg bible.</p>

<p>Constructing them, though, is somewhat of a pain. You have to go through a long series of steps, either in illustrator or by hand, constructing the text block geometrically. So I decided to write a small web app to do it automatically. <a href="http://vandegraaf.azuretalon.com/" target="_blank">Check it out online!</a> Currently, only the most common canon is supported, but in the future I will add any canon I find the need to construct to the project.</p>

<p>If you’re more of a developer, I’ve open sourced the project on <a href="https://github.com/kballenegger/Van-De-Graaf-Generator" target="_blank">github</a> under the Azure License.</p>
