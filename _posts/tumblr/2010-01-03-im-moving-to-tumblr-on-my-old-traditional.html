                        <p>I’m moving to tumblr.</p>

<p>On my old “traditional” blog, there have been no posts in almost three months. A sad situation indeed. I keep telling myself I will try to blog more, and for a while, I keep it up. Yet, eventually, post frequency always dies.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://twitter.com/kob" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, on the other hand, is not abandoned. This leads me to believe that Wordpress, as a medium, might not be the best option to regularly post blog-like content.</p>

<p>Hopefully, the move to tumblr will prompt me to post more thoughts &amp; articles, links with commentary and images from my college design work.</p>

<p>I’ve transferred the blog feed over to this new tumblr feed.</p>

<p>I’m not yet sure if I’m going to keep the old blog for article and releases like <a href="http://www.seoxys.com/warmonger-warcraft-iii-autorefresh-for-mac-os-x/" target="_blank">Warmonger</a>. I’m inclined not to, but then I’d have to deal with transferring content over, and dealing with a bunch of broken links.</p>

<p>Comments are bad, and this new blog does not allow for comments. If you’d like to comment, <a href="http://twitter.com/kob" target="_blank">tweet me</a> or <a href="mailto:kenneth@ballenegger.com" target="_blank">email me</a>.</p>
