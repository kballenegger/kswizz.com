When running on an iPad, it features a new interface thought out specifically for the iPad.
This version also fixes Facebook Share, for both iPhone and iPad.

Only the Premium edition has iPad support. There currently are no plans to bring the Lite edition to the iPad. So if you&amp;#8217;ve been holding out for some great new features to buy the Premium edition, now is the time.

Check your updates, or if you don&amp;#8217;t have iLaugh Premium yet, download it now!"></a></p>
