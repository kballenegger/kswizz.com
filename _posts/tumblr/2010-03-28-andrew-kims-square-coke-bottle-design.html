  Andrew Kim&amp;#8217;s Coke bottle redesign is an ambitious take on the iconic bottle, going square in the name of eco-friendliness. The new bottle shape would take up far less space in shipping pallets per bottle, and a push-up in the bottom large enough to accommodate the cap of the bottle beneath it would enable stacking.


Great industrial design right there. I totally want to switch to these bottles."></a></p>
