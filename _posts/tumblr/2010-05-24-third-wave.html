                            The First Wave was personal computers and the wave of disruption that caused. The second wave was the Internet, ditto. We are now, says Doerr, in the Third Wave. What exactly is the Third Wave? It’s the tectonic shifts we’re seeing in mobile platforms, the social graph, and online commerce.
