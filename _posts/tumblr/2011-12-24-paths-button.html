  <p>Details take time. Details are exhausting, and require a ton of trial and error. I spent at least 5 minutes last night just tapping Pathâ€™s button again and again looking at the animation to try to figure it out exactly, to figure out why it felt so right. Recreating it would take me much longer than those 5 minutes. This exhausting trial and error is how you can manage to create things that not only look good, but feel fantastic.</p>
