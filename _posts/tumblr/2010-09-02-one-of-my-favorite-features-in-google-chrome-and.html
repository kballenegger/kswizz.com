                        <p>One of my favorite features in Google Chrome, and something that I discovered by accident one day, is how the address bar lets you search any site in which it detects a search field.</p>

<p>If, for example, you type “wiki” and press tab, based on your browsing history, it will determine that you most likely meant to search <em>en.wikipedia.org</em>. It will show a blue “Search Wikipedia (en):” element, and you can type in your search term and press enter. You’ll be taken right to the article on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>This works with most popular sites out there. I’ve used it with Netflix, Google Image Search, Wikipedia, Facebook, Stack Overflow, php.net, and of course, YouTube.</p>
