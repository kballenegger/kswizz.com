<blockquote>
  <p>There has never been and never will be a democracy in the Middle East. And those are stupid who think the democracy is what these people are fighting for. No! No! No! These people fight for the piece of bread, for $10 a night… They are just a huge and ugly crowd with stones. What democracy you guys are talking about? Name it! Iran, Iraq, Algeria, Tunisia, Somalia, Saudi Arabia or the most democratically elected Turkish government!? Most of those ‘brave’ commentators of the Egyptian revolution prefer to stay online neither to go in the street. No one really would trade his bottom for a stone flying straight in to your head. Your courage ends up with your facebook and twitter comments. That’s all you can do. But you don’t believe or you simply don’t care what happens next, when Muslim Brothers come to power? What happens next, when those who treat the US and the entire West as an enemy of islam, will control the second largest army in the Middle East? More than 1000 Abrams tanks, F-16 jets… What happens next when these guys to control the Suez? Will they give up their power as you expect them to? Do they continue to reform the democratic institutions? In a certain sense, yes, they will… into the Rule of Shariah with all the out coming consequences. What price you are ready to pay for your gas tomorrow? I’ll tell you what… It’s not the success of the democracy, but the ugliest face of it. And shame on all of you, who think that what has been happening in Egypt is right. It’s not right, it’s not fair, it’s damn dangerous and what is even more terrifying - there is no way back.</p>

<p>I don’t know what’s going to happen next in Egypt. What I do know, however, is that we all like the warm and fuzzies we get from hearing the romantic story of people fighting for their freedom, and for democracy. Unfortunately, the truth is that the repercussions, both for the Egyptian people and for the entire world, will be mostly negative. Egypt turned from a stable country and a US ally in the region into a ungovernable anti-American wildcard. Tourism, crucial to Egypt’s economy, has crumbled, and the country’s image is forever tarnished.</p>
