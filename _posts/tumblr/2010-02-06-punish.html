                            <p>Derek Sivers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nine years ago, one guy tried to light his shoes on fire on a plane. Now for all future time, millions of people a day have to queue up to take our shoes off at the airport, because of that one dumb moment.</p>
  
  <p>[…]</p>
  
  <p>It’s important to resist that simplistic, angry, reactionary urge to punish everyone, and step back to look at the big picture.</p>
