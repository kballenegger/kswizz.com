                            <p>MongoModel is a simple and lightweight ORM for MongoDB and PHP. I finally got around to posting it on GitHub. It’s a simple piece of code, but it’s the backbone for many of my recent projects, including <a href="http://kswizz.com/2011-03-25/meet-chartboost" target="_blank">ChartBoost</a>'s entire backend.</p>
