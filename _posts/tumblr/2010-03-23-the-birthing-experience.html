<blockquote>
  <p>I guess I should consider myself lucky to be able to said that the birth of our son was the most traumatic experience I have EVER lived. Clearly, I’m still shaken by it … Will I do it all over again? F*ck NO!</p>
  
  <p>Often, I’ll hear people talk about how magical and/or miraculous the birth of a baby is and I roll my eyes. There’s nothing miraculous about it, People! It’s a gory painful mess!</p>
