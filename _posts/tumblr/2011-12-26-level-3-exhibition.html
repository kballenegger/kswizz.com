Why, you ask? Because we to finish our projects for the semester, polish off all the work we&amp;#8217;ve done over the past two years, and present it to an intimidating panel of faculty and design professionals. After presenting and talking about our work for 45 minutes, the panel goes away to deliberate and writes up a grade and a feedback sheet which sets the tone for the rest of our path through design school, and our design careers thereafter.

The day after the presentation, after the celebratory hangover has passed, we are assigned a 6&amp;#8217; by 6&amp;#8217; exhibition space, in which we curate and present our strongest work done at CCA. My exhibition is pictured above."></a></p>
