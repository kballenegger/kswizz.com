                        <p>I recently went on a small trip to San Diego. After completing my summer internship with Tapulous, I decided to take some vacation and go explore some of the other great American cities. So I flew down to the port city for a long weekend.</p>

<p>I visited the USS Midway, an impressive retired aircraft carrier turned museum. San Diego being one of America’s greatest Navy ports, it was host to three massive aircraft carrier when I visited, which you could see from across the bay.</p>

<p>Like any self-respecting tourist in San Diego, I made it to Seaworld.</p>

<p>Seaworld had some great shows. I especially enjoyed the funny sea lion show. They’ve got to be my favorite marine creatures, and they were very impressively trained.</p>
