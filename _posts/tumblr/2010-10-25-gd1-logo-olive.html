The last logo had to show the meaning of my name. I went with my middle name, Olivier, which is the original french version of Oliver. Originally from the nordic name, Áleifr, meaning &amp;#8220;elf-host&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;elf-army,&amp;#8221; the spelling was later changed to associate it with the latin word oliva, meaning &amp;#8220;olive tree.&amp;#8221;"></a></p>
