                            <p>David Brooks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In sum, the U.S. is on the verge of a demographic, economic and social revival, built on its historic strengths. The U.S. has always been good at disruptive change. It’s always excelled at decentralized community-building. It’s always had that moral materialism that creates meaning-rich products. Surely a country with this much going for it is not going to wait around passively and let a rotten political culture drag it down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some optimism, at last!</p>

<p>The whole column is worth a read, and does a great job of illustrating what made me decide to move to the United States. This culture of entrepreneurship, innovation and community is what makes America the most successful country on earth. Of course, many will disagree, and I don’t deny that the US has many issues and drawbacks, but it also has a great foundation and spirit giving it immense potential.</p>
