                        <p>Adam Lisagor on the iPad taking the TV’s role in our lives:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has done a tremendous amount of work putting [the iPad] in our hands (and on our knees, chests and laps), and showing us how it fits in our lives, in all the right places. As I said before, all the right places, all those places between on-the-go and at-your-desk, they turn out to be a lot of places. We spend a great deal of time in places other than our offices and in transit. So I think of all those places Apple has, with its advertising, shown us comfortably using the iPad, and I can’t help but note that they’re pretty consistently places where I’d want to mellow out and turn on some TV.</p>
