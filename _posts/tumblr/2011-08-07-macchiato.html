                        <p>This past June, I attended my very first WWDC. The conference, the people and the parties were all amazing, and it was definitely a highlight. Inspired by the spirit of the conference, and all the new technologies presented, I set out to conquer my laziness and build and ship a new app.</p>

<p>I’m a huge fan of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown</a>. So much so that I write nearly everything in it. From emails and notes, to documentation and blog posts. Unfortunately, writing Markdown meant one of two things for me: either launching TextEdit and switching it to plain text mode, or launching TextMate and writing in a code editor. Neither were really suited to the task.</p>

<p>To remedy this, I built Macchiato. I made full use of Lion’s new technologies. In fact, Macchiato <em>only</em> works on Lion. You’ve got full-screen mode, auto-save and versioning. The internals of the app uses <code>NSRegularExpression</code>, sandboxing, Automatic Reference Counting, and several other Lion-only APIs.</p>

<p>Macchiato is about being the very best at doing one thing: writing in Markdown. I’ve tried to keep an emphasis on usability, design and typography. I wanted to make it a joy to use, and for me it did the trick. I use it every day.</p>
