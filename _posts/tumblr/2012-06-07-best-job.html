                        <p>I have the best job in the world.</p>

<p>Every day, I show up to work and create something awesome. It’s like being a kid again except this time, instead of Lego bricks, the building blocks are Objective-C blocks, WebSockets and ØMQ. Clojure, Ruby, and Assembly. I make things that I want to use. I solve problems for the sake of curiosity. I’m like a child in Disneyland, having the time of my life, and I’m being paid to do it.</p>

<p>I’m not doing it because it will make me a bajillionaire. It will, eventually, but that’s besides the point. I do it because I absolutely love being a programmer. I’d spend my time hacking even if it wasn’t my day job. Until recently, actually, it wasn’t. I was three years into a degree in graphic design when I decided that I really wanted to spend my days working on making cool stuff and solving hard problems.</p>

<p>Sure, it’s stressful sometimes. Meetings can eat into your productivity and Mongo can wake you up at two in the morning when an onslaught of asian traffic brings it to its knees. But at the end of the day, these are good problems to have.</p>

<p>If you don’t love your job; if you don’t think it’s the most interesting thing you could be doing right now; if you don’t feel immensely grateful at the universe for having such an awesome gig… quit! Right fucking now. Money, mortgages, degrees, social expectations and obligations are just distractions. A waste of time. Humans are incredibly resilient creatures; we can figure pretty much anything out on the fly. The world is a fantastic place to be, and right now is probably the best time yet to be in it, so why waste your time selling sugared water?</p>
