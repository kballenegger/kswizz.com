  <p>I think my biggest pet-peeve by far is how PRMac handles itself in public. Anytime there is a question on the MacSB mailing list about advertising, press releases or anything remotely related, the site’s proprietor chimes in to plug his service. Just because you wrap your self promotion with <em> :)</em> doesn’t make it right.</p>

<p>As the creator of <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/iphonesb" target="_blank">iPhoneSB</a>, I’ve experienced the same thing. I’ve had to privately ask PRMac’s owner to tone down the self-promotion multiple times.</p>
