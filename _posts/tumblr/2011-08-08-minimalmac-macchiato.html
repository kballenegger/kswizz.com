<blockquote>
  <p>Recently, Ive been taking a tour of various text editors and writing environments in an effort to, well, give them all a fair chance. I’m ashamed to admit that I’m so tied to TextEdit that I far too often give most everything else only a drive-by chance before running back to the comfort and security of what I already know. That said, while I love TextEdit, it does have some areas where it falls short. One of those is syntax highlighting. I love and have long used <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown</a> syntax for markup and wished TextEdit did a better job of helping me with that.</p>
