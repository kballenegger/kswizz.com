                        <p><em>I’m updating and re-releasing this from my old blog. Feel free to use the license in any project. No need to attribute me, the license itself is released into the public domain.</em></p>

<p>Open-source licensing can be a real pain. Some licenses are nearly impossible to decipher, while some (namely—the GNU GPL) are just <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/825/getting-pretty-lonely" target="_blank">pure evil</a>.</p>

<p>I have been trying to find a software license which, like the Creative Commons Attribution license, would let the licensee do pretty much anything with the software, except it would require attribution in a meaningful way. That is to say, a non-intrusive mention in the documentation or about box.</p>

<p>The MIT license came closest to this, and it is the base on which the Azure License was written.</p>

<p>A good way to give attribution, as required by the license, would be a friendly “Contains code by Copyright Holder [linked]” or “Special thanks to Copyright Holder [linked]” in the about box.</p>
