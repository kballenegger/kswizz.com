                            The most stealth cracking countermeasure I ever witnessed was an application that would XOR some of its UI messages with the hash sig of the application binary file, so if you edited the application binary file directly the crack seemed to work just fine â€¦ but then the application would gradually go insane. The cracker who finally posted a working crack was impressed with how simple and devious the countermeasures were.
