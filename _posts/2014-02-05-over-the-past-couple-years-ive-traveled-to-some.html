Instead, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to start slowing sharing these on here. Over the next few months, I&amp;#8217;ll try to post the brief backlog of good photos taken in and around 2013.

This particular photo was taken in the summer of 2012, on a trip to Switzerland. It&amp;#8217;s the Lac de Moiry, a glacier-fueled lake behind a dam."></a></p>
